We are asked to analyze consumer data for the Google Merchandise Store between 2016-2017 in order to develop a model that can more accurately and effectively predict future Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). In the span of 7 weeks, our group diligently analyzed Googleâ€™s original repeat purchasers only model, built and ran multiple alternative models (such as Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.), fine-tuned these models for further improvement and accuracy, and selected a final model that yielded the best result. 

In the end, we created a Gradient Boosting model with a Mean Average Error of 19.18, a 39.6% improvement from the naive model and the lowest Mean Average Error of all models we created. In addition, we also provided recommendations based on the regression model that visitors who were located in the southern region of the United States, purchased in October, used a Safari browser, and performed actively in the first purchase and within one week after the first purchase should be allocated more marketing resources.
